## Assaggio - React-Based Markdown Previewer
A simple markdown previewer built with React using Vite as the build tool following
FreeCodeCamp's Markdown Preview. The user stories include :

- User Story #1 : I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

- User Story #2 : I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

- User Story #3 : When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

- User Story #4 : When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: [Marked Library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked)).

- User Story #5 : When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a heading element (H1 size), a subheading element (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

- User Story #6 : When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.

- Optional Bonus : My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as br (line break) elements.
